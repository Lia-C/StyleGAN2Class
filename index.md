# Artificial Images: StyleGAN2 Deep Dive

# Overview

[Artificial Images: StyleGAN2 Deep Dive](https://bustbright.square.site/product/machine-learning-class-stylegan/286) is a course for image makers (graphic designers, artists, illustrators and photographer) to learn about StyleGAN2. In this course you will learn about the history of GANs, the basics of StyleGAN and advanced features to get the most out of any StyleGAN2 model. Advanced topics will include training non-square models, mixing datasets, modifying training commands and a number of interpolation methods (image projection, vector manipulation, etc). 

Class meets on Sundays Apr 12 - May 10, at 12:30pm - 2pm EDT (1.5 hour sessions).

Taught by [Derrick Schultz](https://twitter.com/dvsch?lang=en) and TA [Lia Coleman](https://twitter.com/Lialialiacole).

- **Week 1:** History of GANs, Inspiration, Environment Setup
- **Week 2:** StyleGAN Training Basics
- **Week 3**: StyleGAN Manipulation: Interpolation, Projection, Truncation
- **Week 4**: Advanced StyleGAN Techniques
- **Week 5:** Next Steps: Project Feedback, Your Own GPU Setup, Open Q&A

# Week 1, April 12

To-do before this class:
1. Set up your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) server. This is what we will be using in class for GPUs. Here are [instructions on how to set up GCP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBPJh33T3yQ). Expect this to take 30 minutes in one sitting. Don’t worry, this is the longest task in this list, everything else should be a breeze!
2. Bookmark this page!
3. Fill out the [pre-class survey](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VYk7B0Chd534rVvE_1c4FTsRNk_ftWkB4qo2TPmM1X4).
4. Join our [Slack](https://ml-images.slack.com/) and poke around! For our class, we will be communicating through the `#stylegan2-deepdive` channel.
5. Introduce yourself to your classmates in the `#stylegan2-deepdive` channel. Say hi to each other! Some starter questions: Where are you located? What do you do? What experience do you have already? What do you want to learn or make? And links to your IG / twitter / website. :)
6. Read our class [Code of Conduct and Zoom Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6X4_uEdlx3Xo9ZM73nlltc690DcP4geSjImUEA7K98/edit?usp=sharing).
